Natural Language Processing and Text Analysis

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful and useful way. It combines computational linguistics with machine learning.

NLP Applications:

1. Text Classification
- Sentiment analysis for customer feedback
- Spam detection in emails
- Topic categorization
- Document classification

2. Named Entity Recognition
- Identifying people, organizations, and locations
- Extracting key information from documents
- Information extraction from unstructured text

3. Language Understanding
- Part-of-speech tagging
- Dependency parsing
- Syntax tree generation
- Semantic role labeling

4. Text Generation
- Machine translation between languages
- Automatic summarization
- Question answering systems
- Dialogue systems and chatbots

5. Information Retrieval
- Search engines
- Document ranking
- Query understanding
- Relevance scoring

Modern NLP uses word embeddings and transformer models like BERT to capture semantic meaning of text effectively.
