Deep Learning Models and Neural Architectures

Deep learning has revolutionized artificial intelligence with powerful neural network architectures capable of learning complex patterns from data. These models process information through multiple layers of abstraction.

Popular Deep Learning Architectures:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Designed for image processing
- Convolutional layers extract local features
- Pooling layers reduce dimensionality
- Widely used in computer vision
- Object detection and recognition

2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Process sequential data
- Maintain hidden state across time steps
- Suitable for time series and text
- Language modeling and translation
- Vanishing gradient problem

3. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Advanced RNN variant
- Gated memory cells
- Better gradient flow
- Effective for long-term dependencies
- Speech recognition and text generation

4. Transformer Architecture
- Self-attention mechanisms
- Parallel processing capability
- Foundation for modern NLP
- BERT, GPT, and T5 models
- Exceptional performance on language tasks

5. Autoencoders
- Unsupervised learning architecture
