Semantic Search and Natural Language Processing

Semantic search is an advanced information retrieval method that understands the contextual meaning of search queries. Unlike traditional keyword-based search, semantic search can understand:

1. User Intent
- The actual meaning behind the search query
- The context of the search
- Related concepts and synonyms

2. Content Understanding
- Natural language processing
- Entity recognition
- Relationship between concepts

3. Vector Embeddings
- Mathematical representation of text
- Similarity calculations
- Contextual meaning preservation
