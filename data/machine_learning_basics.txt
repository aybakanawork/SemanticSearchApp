Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Key Concepts in Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
- Learning from labeled training data
- Regression and classification tasks
- Supervised models require input-output pairs

2. Unsupervised Learning
- Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- Clustering and dimensionality reduction
- Discovering hidden structures

3. Neural Networks
- Inspired by biological neural systems
- Deep learning architectures
- Multi-layer perceptron models
- Backpropagation for training

4. Feature Engineering
- Extracting meaningful features from raw data
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Dimensionality reduction techniques

Machine learning applications span across computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and recommendation systems.
