Understanding Vector Embeddings and Similarity

Vector embeddings represent words, phrases, or documents as numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space. These representations capture semantic and syntactic information about the text they represent.

Word Embeddings Explained:

1. Word2Vec
- Skip-gram and CBOW models
- Continuous bag of words approach
- Word context relationships
- Efficient training on large corpora

2. GloVe (Global Vectors)
- Combines global matrix factorization
- Leverages word co-occurrence statistics
- Captures global word relationships
- Better for rare words than Word2Vec

3. FastText
- Handles out-of-vocabulary words
- Uses subword information
- Builds on Word2Vec architecture
- Better for morphologically rich languages

4. Transformer-based Embeddings
- BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT
- Context-aware representations
- Bidirectional encoding
- Pre-trained on large text corpora

Similarity Metrics:

1. Cosine Similarity
- Measures angle between vectors
- Range from -1 to 1
- Most common for embeddings
- Computationally efficient

2. Euclidean Distance
- L2 norm based distance
- Actual spatial distance
- Sensitive to magnitude
- Used in clustering

Embeddings are fundamental to semantic search, recommendation systems, and modern NLP applications.
